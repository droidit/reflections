Q) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working with other programmers,remote repo will function as the common repo as the main stable code base 
from where each can retrieve or push code to.

Q) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The latest stable code may have changed in the remote repo. A manual pull before pushing code will help in avoiding conflicts in the code.

Q) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork and Clone are used to make a copy of a repository into a new repository.
Fork is to copy a repo from a git hub account to another
Clone is to copy a repo from git hub account(remote) to local machine or 
to copy a local repo into another.

Branch divides a single repo into different working areas inside a repo.
With branch we can make a copy of the main code repo and make changes to it and merge with the master commit.  A bit unclear in the explaination. will revisit and change this on getting clarification.
